consensusNetR is an R Package for combining networks into a consensus
network based on the work of [Laura Cantini and Andrei
Zinovyev](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/21/4307/5426054).
In addition to identifying consensus based on correlation of community
meta-genes (loadings or membership scores), we also implement methods
based on overlap.
