# consensusNet
R Package for combining networks into a consensus network based on the work of [Laura Cantini and Andrei Zinovyev](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/21/4307/5426054). In addition to identifying consensus based on correlation of community meta-genes (loadings or membership scores), we also implement methods based on overlap.
