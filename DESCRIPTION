Description: consensusNet provides tools for combining the results of
    metagene clustering in different studies, datasets, and using
    different methods.  It combines results and finds consensus
    communities of metagenes between studies which appear to represent
    similar metagenes (gene signatures), and tagging genes with their
    respective communities.
