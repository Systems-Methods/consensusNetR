Description: consensusNet provides tools for combining the results of metagene 
  clustering in different studies, datasets, and using different methods. 
  It combines results and finds consensus communities of metagenes between 
  studies which appear to represent similar metagenes (gene signatures), and 
  tagging genes with their respective communities.
